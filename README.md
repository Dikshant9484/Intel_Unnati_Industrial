Automated Sorting System using Mechatronics
principle

I am doing this project for automatically sorting system using mechatronics principle , which generally deals with the idea of implementing robotics hands which sorts the object on the basis of colour, shape , size. maintaing the accuracy, modularity, and enhances the usefulness.
Approach
The approach involves:
• Object Recognition: Randomly generating objects with different properties.
• Path Planning: Simulating a robotic arm’s movement to pick and place objects
efficiently.
• Animation and Visualization: Using OpenCV to create smooth and realistic robotic
animations.
• Sorting Logic: Sorting objects into color-coded bins based on their attributes.
Workflow
1. Object Generation: Randomly create objects with different colors, shapes, and
sizes.
2. Robotic Arm Activation: The arm starts in an idle state, awaiting object pickup.
3. Object Detection & Sorting: The robotic arm identifies an object’s color and moves
to the respective bin.
4. Placement in Bins: Objects are placed in corresponding bins according to color.
5. Repeat Process: The cycle continues until all objects are sorted.
