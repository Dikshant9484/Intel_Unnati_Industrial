Automated Sorting System using Mechatronics
principle

The challenge in industrial automation is to efficiently sort objects based on predefined
attributes such as color, shape, or size. Manual sorting is inefficient and prone to errors,
making automated sorting systems an essential component of modern manufacturing
units. This project aims to simulate a robotic sorting system that autonomously identifies
and sorts objects into predefined bins using mechatronics principles.



I am doing this project for automatically sorting system using mechatronics principle , which generally deals with the idea of implementing robotics hands which sorts the object on the basis of colour, shape , size. maintaing the accuracy, modularity, and enhances the usefulness.

Approach

The approach involves:
• Object Recognition: Randomly generating objects with different properties.
• Path Planning: Simulating a robotic arm’s movement to pick and place objects
efficiently.
• Animation and Visualization: Using OpenCV to create smooth and realistic robotic
animations.
• Sorting Logic: Sorting objects into color-coded bins based on their attributes.

Workflow

1. Object Generation: Randomly create objects with different colors, shapes, and
sizes.
2. Robotic Arm Activation: The arm starts in an idle state, awaiting object pickup.
3. Object Detection & Sorting: The robotic arm identifies an object’s color and moves
to the respective bin.
4. Placement in Bins: Objects are placed in corresponding bins according to color.
5. Repeat Process: The cycle continues until all objects are sorted.

   ✅Realistic Robotic Arm Movement
   
• The robotic arm moves smoothly to pick and place objects.
• Objects are scattered instead of stacked, making sorting more challenging.
✅Random Object Generation

• The simulation randomly generates objects with different attributes.
✅Sorting into Three Compartments

• Objects are placed into three separate bins instead of a stack.
✅Enhanced UI with Vibrant Background

• The simulation uses bright colors for better visualization.
✅Realistic Robotic Hand with Wires.

 Working Mechanism
 
 Object Generation
 
1. Randomly generates objects with different shapes, sizes, and colors.
2. Objects appear in scattered locations rather than stacked.
3. 

 Robotic Arm Movement

 
1. The arm moves down to pick an object.
2. It lifts the object and moves toward the corresponding color bin.
3. Finally, it places the object in the bin and moves back to the next object.
